Cusco is a set of game agnostic C# modules. Initially developed for _Project Lima_, Supraxel decided to open-source them
so they can benefit the community and _Project Lima_ itself.
They target either .NET 7 or .NET Standard 2.1 (Unity 2022+ compatible).

## Getting started

You can find the Cusco modules on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Cusco). 

## Project structure

This project uses [NX](https://nx.dev/) with the [NX Dotnet](https://www.nx-dotnet.com/) plugin.

If you're not familiar with NX or the [Monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) philosophy, it might be a good idea to check
their [documentation](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro) first ðŸ™‚

## Where to start ?

Run the following commands to install the development dependencies and show the documentation.

```
npm install
npm serve docs
```
